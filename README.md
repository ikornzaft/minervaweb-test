# "Aprender en red" Web App

This project was created entirely with JavaScript, React.js and Chakra.ui.

It's an initiative of the "Instituto de Investigaci√≥n para el Desarrollo" from Paraguay, funded by the CONACyT. 

The goal of this project is to bring a tool that facilitates communication between teacher and students, and within the educational community itself.
